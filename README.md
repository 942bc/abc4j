# abc4j (fork)

## statement

This is a fork of the [abc4j](https://code.google.com/p/abc4j/) library. The code was originally written by Lionel Guéganton (2006–2008), continued by pipemakertjm (2009) and Sylvain Machefert (iubito) (2009–2011). This library is published under the [GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) v3+](https://raw.github.com/Sciss/abc4j/master/LICENSE). All modifications (C)opyright 2013 by Hanns Holger Rutz, released by that same license.

Why a fork? (a) I needed to get an easy handle on the source. (b) I am planning to strip this down to a plain score display component. (c) Github instead of Google-Code. (d) Building with sbt. (e) Publishing (eventually) to Maven Central, making it available for automatic dependency management.

To contact Hanns Holger Rutz, send a mail to `contact@sciss.de`.
